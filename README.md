This is the repo for my project for the summer 2015 Insight Health Data Science session in Boston, MA.
For this project I was a consultant to a Fortune 500 healcare company. The company's goal was to be able
to take advantage of customer's reviews on social media to optimize pricing and distribution strategies.
To accomplish this goal I webscraped over 13000 comments about drugs from AskAPatient and built a Naive
Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis of the comments. With this the company is able to determine the
relative popularity of drugs that they distribute

This repo houses the three script used to colled the data, and train and test the model:
